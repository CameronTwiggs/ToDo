    <h1>Test</h1>
    <p>I was able to get the backend to work and the front end to look fine, </p>
    <p>I encountered an issue that stopped this whole project from working out in the first place </p>
    <p>let me explain</p>
    <p>My, Database, Backend and Frontend are all hosted</p>
    <p>My Express API is sending requests in HTTP and not HTTPS and what that means is that I coudldnt fetch the data from the API but it kept returning HTTP requests and thats blocked on my site for some reason</p>
    <p>Try it yourself</p>
    <a href="http://54.197.13.168:8080/">54.197.13.168:8080 HTTP</a>
    <a href="https://54.197.13.168:8080/">54.197.13.168:8080 HTTPS</a>
    <p>If it wasnt for this fact I would have been done by now</p>
